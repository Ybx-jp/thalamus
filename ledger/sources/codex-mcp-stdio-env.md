#### STDIO servers

- `command` (required): The command that starts the server.
- `args` (optional): Arguments to pass to the server.
- `env` (optional): Environment variables to set for the server.
- `env_vars` (optional): Environment variables to allow and forward.
- `cwd` (optional): Working directory to start the server from.
- `experimental_environment` (optional): Set to `remote` to start the stdio
  server through a remote executor environment when one is available.

`env_vars` can contain plain variable names or objects with a source:

```toml
env_vars = ["LOCAL_TOKEN", { name = "REMOTE_TOKEN", source = "remote" }]
```

String entries and `source = "local"` read from Codex's local environment.
