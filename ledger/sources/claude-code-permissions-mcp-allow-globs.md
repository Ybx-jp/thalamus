### Tool name wildcards

Allow rules accept tool-name globs only after a literal `mcp__<server>__` prefix. The server segment must be glob-free so the rule names a specific server you configured. `mcp__puppeteer__*` matches every tool from the `puppeteer` server, and `mcp__github__get_*` matches its `get_` tools. An unanchored allow glob such as `"*"`, `"B*"`, or `"mcp__*"` is skipped with a warning and doesn't auto-approve anything.
