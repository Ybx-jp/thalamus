## Where Codex looks for hooks

Codex discovers hooks next to active config layers in either of these forms:

- `hooks.json`
- inline `[hooks]` tables inside `config.toml`

Installed plugins can also bundle lifecycle config through their plugin
manifest or a default `hooks/hooks.json` file. See [Build
plugins](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/build/plugins#bundled-mcp-servers-and-lifecycle-hooks) for the
plugin packaging rules.

In practice, the four most useful locations are:

- `~/.codex/hooks.json`
- `~/.codex/config.toml`
- `<repo>/.codex/hooks.json`
- `<repo>/.codex/config.toml`

If more than one hook source exists, Codex loads all matching hooks.
Higher-precedence config layers don't replace lower-precedence hooks.
If a single layer contains both `hooks.json` and inline `[hooks]`, Codex
merges them and warns at startup. Prefer one representation per layer.

Codex can also discover hooks bundled with enabled plugins. Plugin-bundled
hooks load alongside other hook sources and use the same trust-review flow as
other non-managed hooks.

Project-local hooks load only when the project `.codex/` layer is trusted. In
untrusted projects, Codex still loads user and system hooks from their own
active config layers.
