### Common input fields

| `prompt_id` | UUID identifying the user prompt currently being processed. Matches the [`prompt.id` attribute on OpenTelemetry events](/docs/en/monitoring-usage#event-correlation-attributes), so you can correlate hook output with telemetry for a single prompt. Absent until the first user input. Requires Claude Code v2.1.196 or later |
| `transcript_path` | Path to conversation JSON. The transcript file is written asynchronously and may lag the in-memory conversation, so it may not yet include the current turn's most recent messages when a hook fires. Hooks that need the final assistant text of the current turn should use `last_assistant_message` on [Stop](#stop) and [SubagentStop](#subagentstop) instead of reading the transcript |

### JSON output

| `continue` | `true` | If `false`, Claude stops processing entirely after the hook runs. Takes precedence over any event-specific decision fields |
| `stopReason` | none | Message shown to the user when `continue` is `false`. It stays in the conversation, so Claude sees it if the conversation continues |

### PostToolBatch decision control

Returning `decision: "block"` or `continue: false` stops the agentic loop before the next model call. The blocking message comes from the JSON `reason` or `stopReason`, or from stderr on exit 2. You see it as a warning in the transcript, and it stays in the conversation, so Claude sees it when the conversation continues.
